# A small ssh list tool
## Background
I need a light-weight tool to list the servers that can be connected via ssh. However, I find no one. Therefore, I create it.

It's only a small tool.

Read configration from `$HOME/.ssh/config`.

## Installation
> python2 need to choose version 0.1.2, version above 0.2.0 only supports python3.

```python
pip install tobe
```
